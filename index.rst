Python Qt tutorial
==================

This is a short tutorial on using Qt from Python. There are two main versions of
Qt in use (Qt4 and Qt5) and several Python libraries to use Qt from Python (PyQt
and PySide), but rather than picking one of these, this tutorial makes use of
the `QtPy <https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy>`_ package which provides a way to
use whatever Python Qt package is available.

This is not meant to be a completely exhaustive tutorial but just a place to
start if you've never done Qt development before.
