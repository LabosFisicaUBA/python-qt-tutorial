Installing
==========

conda
-----

If you use conda to manage your Python environment (for example as part of
Anaconda or Miniconda), you can easily install Qt, PyQt5, and QtPy (a common
interface to all Python Qt bindings) using::

    conda install pyqt qtpy

pip
---

If you don't make use of conda, an easy way to install Qt, PyQt5, and QtPy is
to do::

    pip install pyqt5 qtpy
